version 0.7.2
	- Longwave urban modifications to give correct emission from
	  walls, fixing error most noticeable with 2-streams - see
	  radtool_legendre_gauss.F90 and radsurf_urban_lw.F90
	- Added test/simple/test_noscat_in.nc test case
	- Added test/simple/test_simple_1stream_out.nc target
	- Added ground-level fluxes into a vertical plane
	  (ground_flux_vertical_diffuse_sw and ground_flux_vertical_lw)
	  needed to compute mean radiant temperature and comfort indices

version 0.7.1 (23 October 2020)
	- Added Apache license statement to each source file
	- Fixed behaviour when vegetation or building fraction are zero in
	  a layer, and added two new cases in test/simple to check

version 0.4 (19 December 2019)
	- Fixed calc_matrices_[lw|sw] using eigenvalue decomposition
